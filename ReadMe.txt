Installation
------------

There is nothing special about installing the code for this book. All you need to do is unzip the files into a directory of your choosing. Once unzipped, you will find a directory for each chapter (which has source code). Most chapters have a project file which you will double click to start Visual Studio 2005. The chapters that don't have a project file have a batch file for building the programs that make up the chapter. For these directories you can use any editor to edit the source code contained within them (though, I used Visual Studio 2005 for these as well).

You have a choice of getting your updates from either www.apress.com or www.procppcli.net. The most up-to-date will be found on www.procppcli.net as I maintain this site.

Online Community

As I stated in my book, I will continue to provide information on C++/CLI on my Web site www.procppcli.net. I will also make the site available to other authors and developers to write about or provide code written in C++/CLI. The site currently has a FAQ, Discussion, article and download areas. I plan in the future (if demand supports it) a job site. I am also open for suggestions.
